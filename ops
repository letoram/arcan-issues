The primary arcan connection should\nalso be able to access audio. The implementation should be similar enough to\nsdl2 audio. The main complication is accessing the context that will be used\nfor audio. There is a global helper accessor: arcan_shmif_setprimary and\narcan_shmif_primary for the slots that could be used for getting the current\naudio device and making it retargettable in the future.\n\nThe big caveat to look out for is if the context gets remapped through a resize\nor crash recovery action, as that will cause addresses to possibly, but not\nalways, be remapped.","files":null}]}
